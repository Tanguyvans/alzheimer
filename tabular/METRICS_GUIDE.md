# Alzheimer's Disease Classification Metrics Guide

This document explains all metrics and features used in the XGBoost-based Alzheimer's Disease classification system.

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to classify patients into:
- **CN (Cognitively Normal)** - Class 0
- **AD (Alzheimer's Disease)** - Class 1
- **MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)** - Intermediate state, classified as CN-like or AD-like

The classification is based on clinical assessment scores and demographic data from the ADNI dataset.

## üìä Performance Metrics

### 1. **Confusion Matrix**
A 2x2 table showing prediction accuracy:

```
                Predicted
                CN    AD
Actual  CN     TN    FP
        AD     FN    TP
```

- **TN (True Negative)**: CN correctly identified as CN
- **FP (False Positive)**: CN incorrectly labeled as AD
- **FN (False Negative)**: AD incorrectly labeled as CN  
- **TP (True Positive)**: AD correctly identified as AD

### 2. **Core Metrics**

#### **Accuracy**
- **Formula**: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- **Meaning**: Overall percentage of correct predictions
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Clinical**: How often the model is right overall

#### **Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**
- **Formula**: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Meaning**: When model predicts AD, how often is it correct?
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Clinical**: Reduces false alarms - important for patient anxiety

#### **Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **Formula**: TP / (TP + FN)
- **Meaning**: Of all actual AD cases, how many did we catch?
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Clinical**: Critical for early intervention - missing AD is dangerous

#### **Specificity**
- **Formula**: TN / (TN + FP)
- **Meaning**: Of all actual CN cases, how many did we correctly identify?
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Clinical**: Avoids unnecessary worry in healthy individuals

#### **F1 Score**
- **Formula**: 2 √ó (Precision √ó Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Meaning**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Clinical**: Balanced measure when both false positives and false negatives matter

### 3. **Clinical Interpretation**

| Metric | Good Value | Clinical Priority |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Recall** | > 0.85 | Don't miss AD cases |
| **Precision** | > 0.80 | Avoid false alarms |
| **F1 Score** | > 0.80 | Balanced performance |
| **Specificity** | > 0.75 | Don't worry healthy people |

#### **6. TRAASCOR - Trail Making Test A**
- **Type**: Processing Speed/Attention
- **Task**: Connect numbered circles in sequence (1-2-3-4...)
- **Score**: Time in seconds (lower is better)

### **Demographic Features**

- **Factors**: Hormonal, genetic, longevity differences

#### **9. PTDOBYY - Birth Year (Age)**

- **AD Relevance**: Primary risk factor - older age = higher risk
- **Mechanism**: Brain aging and pathology accumulation

#### **10. Additional Features**

## ‚öñÔ∏è Class Imbalance Handling

### **Scale Pos Weight**
- **Purpose**: Address unequal class distribution
- **Formula**: Number of CN cases / Number of AD cases
- **Effect**: Gives more importance to minority class (usually AD)
- **Values Tested**:
  - Default (1.0): No adjustment
  - Balanced: Automatic ratio calculation
  - 2x Weight: Double the calculated ratio
  - 3x Weight: Triple the calculated ratio

### **Why Important?**
- AD cases are typically fewer than CN cases
- Without adjustment, model may ignore AD class
- Proper weighting improves AD detection sensitivity

## üìà Model Variants Compared

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **XGBoost Default** | No class weighting | Balanced datasets |
| **XGBoost Balanced** | Automatic weight calculation | Most imbalanced datasets |
| **XGBoost 2x Weight** | Double emphasis on AD | High recall needed |
| **XGBoost 3x Weight** | Triple emphasis on AD | Maximum AD detection |

---

## üéØ Clinical Decision Making

### **High Recall Strategy** (Catch all AD)
- Accept more false positives
- Better safe than sorry approach
- Use higher class weights

### **High Precision Strategy** (Avoid false alarms)
- Accept missing some AD cases
- Minimize patient anxiety
- Use lower class weights

### **Balanced Strategy** (F1 optimization)
- Balance both concerns
- Most practical for screening
- Use moderate class weights

## üîÑ MCI Patient Classification

### Understanding MCI Predictions

The model trained on **CN vs AD** is used to classify MCI patients:

- **CN-like (Stable)**: MCI patients whose cognitive patterns resemble healthy controls
  - Lower probability of AD (< 0.5)
  - Better cognitive test scores
  - May remain stable or revert to normal

- **AD-like (At Risk)**: MCI patients whose cognitive patterns resemble AD patients
  - Higher probability of AD (‚â• 0.5)
  - Declining cognitive function
  - Higher risk of progression to Alzheimer's

### Typical MCI Distribution

Based on current dataset (1,980 samples):
- **Total MCI patients**: 845
- **CN-like**: ~60% (509 patients)
- **AD-like**: ~40% (336 patients)

### Risk Stratification

MCI patients are categorized by AD probability:

| Probability Range | Category | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| 0.0 - 0.2 | Very CN-like | Very low risk, stable |
| 0.2 - 0.4 | CN-like | Low risk, monitor |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | Uncertain | Moderate risk, close monitoring |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | AD-like | High risk, intervention recommended |
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Very AD-like | Very high risk, immediate intervention |

## üî¨ Clinical Validation

### **Cross-Validation**
- **Method**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- **Purpose**: Ensure model generalizes to new patients
- **Report**: Mean ¬± standard deviation of performance

### **Best Practices**
1. Always report both sensitivity and specificity
2. Consider clinical cost of false negatives vs false positives
3. Validate on independent test set
4. Report confidence intervals
5. Compare to clinical gold standards
